### ShareableCardGenerator Class

The core card generation uses `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` to create high-resolution images:

```swift
// Generate a card
let card = ShareableCardGenerator.generateCard(
    for: rockResult,
    style: .vibrant,
    content: .default
)
```

### Card Styles

Each style implements different visual approaches:
- **Classic**: Clean white background, minimal styling
- **Vibrant**: Gradient backgrounds, colorful borders, enhanced shadows
- **Scientific**: Grid pattern, structured layout, technical aesthetic
- **Social**: Square format, bold text, social media optimized

### Content Customization

Users can choose what information to include:
- Rock image (always recommended)
- Basic info (name, category)
- Physical properties
- Chemical properties  
- Formation information
- Uses and fun facts
- Confidence level
- App branding

## Integration Points

### From Result View

The enhanced sharing is accessible from the main result view via:
- **"Create & Share"** button - Opens full customization interface
- **"Quick Share"** button - Original functionality for basic sharing

### Sharing Flow

1. User views rock identification result
2. Taps "Create & Share" 
3. Chooses card style and content options
