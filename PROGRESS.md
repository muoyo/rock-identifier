# Rock Identifier: Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture
✅ **Completed**

### Implemented:
- Project structure with appropriate directories
- Core models:
  - RockIdentificationResult
  - PhysicalProperties
  - ChemicalProperties
  - Formation
  - Uses
- Core services:
  - RockIdentificationService
  - CollectionManager
  - ConnectionRequest
- Basic UI components:
  - CameraView with rock positioning guide
  - Basic ContentView structure
  - Onboarding flow
- Data persistence framework using UserDefaults
- Integration with OpenAI Vision API (via PHP proxy)

### Next Steps:
- Set up Xcode project configuration files (.xcodeproj)
- Create Assets.xcassets contents (app icon, colors, etc.)
- Implement dark mode support
- Add unit tests for core models and services

## Phase 2: UI Implementation - Main Screens
⏳ **Up Next**

- Create splash screen with app branding
- Implement detailed result screens with tabbed interface
- Design the "A-HA moment" animation sequence
- Build out the detailed property screens
- Implement processing screen with step indicators

## Action Items:
1. Create Xcode project files and integrate the existing Swift files
2. Design and implement app icon and visual assets
3. Refine OpenAI prompt engineering for optimal rock identification
4. Test the core identification flow with sample rock images
5. Begin implementation of Phase 2 UI components

## Notes:
- The app currently follows a freemium model with a limit of 7 identifications for free tier users
- The core architecture supports JSON serialization for data persistence
- Camera view is optimized for rock photography with positioning guide and lighting tips
- Error handling framework is in place but detailed implementation will come in Phase 5
