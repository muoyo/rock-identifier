# Rock Identifier: Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture
✅ **Completed**

### Implemented:
- Project structure with appropriate directories
- Core models:
  - RockIdentificationResult
  - PhysicalProperties
  - ChemicalProperties
  - Formation
  - Uses
- Core services:
  - RockIdentificationService
  - CollectionManager
  - ConnectionRequest
- Basic UI components:
  - CameraView with rock positioning guide
  - Basic ContentView structure
  - Onboarding flow
- Data persistence framework using UserDefaults
- Integration with OpenAI Vision API (via PHP proxy)

### Completed:
- Set up Xcode project configuration files (.xcodeproj)
- Created Assets.xcassets contents (app icon, colors, etc.)
- Implemented dark mode support
- Added unit tests for core models and services

### Phase 1 is now complete! Ready to move on to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: UI Implementation - Main Screens
⏳ **In Progress**

### Implemented:
- Created splash screen with animated crystal and viewfinder design
- Enhanced onboarding carousel with 4 custom screens
- Implemented proper permission handling for camera access
- Added persistence for onboarding completion status
- Created custom SVG illustrations for each onboarding screen
- Improved UI design with dynamic gradients and geometric patterns
- Enhanced Camera Interface with:
  - Advanced rock positioning guide with depth indicators
  - Intuitive remaining identifications counter with visual feedback
  - Improved photo library access with haptic feedback
  - Animated capture button with fluid transitions
  - Context-sensitive positioning and lighting guidance
  - Optimized camera settings for close-up rock photography
- Created advanced Processing Screen with:
  - Animated step-by-step progress indicators
  - Sequential processing stages with smooth transitions
  - Visual scanning effect over the rock image
  - Detailed stage descriptions and progress visualization
  - Haptic feedback for key processing milestones
  - Cancel option with confirmation dialog
  - Error handling with recovery options

### Up Next:
- Create result screens with the "A-HA moment" animation sequence
- Build tabbed interface for detailed property views
- Implement rock collection management screen

## Action Items:
1. Develop Result Screens with multi-tab interface
2. Connect processing flow to RockIdentificationService
3. Refine OpenAI prompt engineering for optimal rock identification
4. Test the core identification flow with sample rock images
5. Implement collection management functionality

## Notes:
- The app follows a freemium model with a hard limit of 3 identifications for free tier users
- Camera permissions are now properly handled with clear explanations
- Onboarding illustrations use SVG format for crisp rendering at all sizes
- User interface follows a consistent design language with attention to animation details
