- Created custom SVG illustrations for each onboarding screen
- Improved UI design with dynamic gradients and geometric patterns
- Enhanced Camera Interface with:
  - Advanced rock positioning guide with depth indicators
  - Intuitive remaining identifications counter with visual feedback
  - Improved photo library access with haptic feedback
  - Animated capture button with fluid transitions
  - Context-sensitive positioning and lighting guidance
  - Optimized camera settings for close-up rock photography
- Created advanced Processing Screen with:
  - Animated step-by-step progress indicators
  - Sequential processing stages with smooth transitions
  - Visual scanning effect over the rock image
  - Detailed stage descriptions and progress visualization
  - Haptic feedback for key processing milestones
  - Cancel option with confirmation dialog
  - Error handling with recovery options
- Implemented comprehensive Result Screens with:
  - Delightful A-HA moment reveal animation with sequential component display
  - Multi-tabbed interface for organized property presentation
  - Detailed Physical Properties tab with visual property indicators
  - Chemical Properties tab with formula and element composition breakdown
  - Formation tab with geological context and location information
  - Uses tab with rotating "Did You Know" facts for the A-HA moment
  - Collection management with Add to Collection and Share functionality
  - Animated confidence indicator with color-coded feedback
  - Notes feature for user annotations
  - Smooth transitions and haptic feedback throughout the experience

## Phase 3: Collection Management
⏳ **In Progress**

### Current Focus:
- Enhancing the CollectionManager class with improved data management
- Developing the CollectionItem model with proper Codable support
- Building the collection grid UI using SwiftUI's LazyVGrid
- Implementing filtering, favoriting, and sorting capabilities
- Creating an intuitive and delightful collection browsing experience

### Action Items (Short-term):
1. Review existing CollectionManager and enhance with timestamp tracking
2. Create CollectionItem model with all necessary properties
3. Implement basic grid layout for the collection view
4. Add filtering controls (All/Favorites/Recent)
5. Design empty state for new users with guidance

### Action Items (Mid-term):
1. Build collection item detail view with all properties
2. Implement edit functionality for collection items
3. Add search and advanced filtering capabilities
4. Create swipe actions for quick item management
5. Implement bulk selection mode for batch operations

### Action Items (Long-term):
1. Optimize collection storage for performance
2. Enhance data persistence with error handling
3. Add sharing and export functionality
4. Apply visual polish and performance optimization
5. Ensure smooth transitions and animations

## Notes:
- The app follows a freemium model with a hard limit of 3 identifications for free tier users
- Camera permissions are now properly handled with clear explanations
- Onboarding illustrations use SVG format for crisp rendering at all sizes
- User interface follows a consistent design language with attention to animation details
