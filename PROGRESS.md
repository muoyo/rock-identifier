# Rock Identifier: Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Architecture
✅ **Completed**

### Implemented:
- Project structure with appropriate directories
- Core models:
  - RockIdentificationResult
  - PhysicalProperties
  - ChemicalProperties
  - Formation
  - Uses
- Core services:
  - RockIdentificationService
  - CollectionManager
  - ConnectionRequest
- Basic UI components:
  - CameraView with rock positioning guide
  - Basic ContentView structure
  - Onboarding flow
- Data persistence framework using UserDefaults
- Integration with OpenAI Vision API (via PHP proxy)

### Completed:
- Set up Xcode project configuration files (.xcodeproj)
- Created Assets.xcassets contents (app icon, colors, etc.)
- Implemented dark mode support
- Added unit tests for core models and services

### Phase 1 is now complete! Ready to move on to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: UI Implementation - Main Screens
⏳ **In Progress**

### Implemented:
- Created splash screen with animated crystal and viewfinder design
- Enhanced onboarding carousel with 4 custom screens
- Implemented proper permission handling for camera access
- Added persistence for onboarding completion status
- Created custom SVG illustrations for each onboarding screen
- Improved UI design with dynamic gradients and geometric patterns

### Up Next:
- Adapt CameraView with rock positioning guide
- Implement remaining identifications counter
- Design processing screen with animated indicators
- Create result screens with the "A-HA moment" animation sequence
- Build tabbed interface for detailed property views

## Action Items:
1. Complete Camera Interface implementation
2. Implement Processing Screen with animation
3. Develop Result Screens with multi-tab interface
4. Refine OpenAI prompt engineering for optimal rock identification
5. Test the core identification flow with sample rock images

## Notes:
- The app follows a freemium model with limited identifications for free tier users
- Camera permissions are now properly handled with clear explanations
- Onboarding illustrations use SVG format for crisp rendering at all sizes
- User interface follows a consistent design language with attention to animation details
