# Rock Identifier: Crystal ID

A mobile application that enables users to instantly identify rocks, minerals, crystals, and gemstones using AI-powered computer vision.

## Project Overview

Rock Identifier: Crystal ID helps casual rock enthusiasts identify their discoveries through a simple, user-friendly interface. The app uses OpenAI's Vision API to provide accurate identifications along with detailed information about each specimen.

## Core Features

- **Camera-First UI**: Optimized for capturing rock specimens
- **AI-Powered Identification**: Accurate recognition of rocks, minerals, crystals, and gemstones
- **Comprehensive Information**: Physical properties, chemical composition, formation details, and uses
- **Educational Content**: Fascinating facts that create an emotional connection with each find
- **Collection Management**: Save and organize identified specimens

## Technical Implementation

This project is built with:

- **SwiftUI**: For modern, declarative UI
- **OpenAI Vision API**: Connected through a secure PHP proxy
- **Custom Prompt Engineering**: Specialized for geological identification
- **UserDefaults**: For local data persistence

## Project Structure

- **Models**: Data structures for rock properties and identification results
- **Views**: UI components for camera, results, and collection management
- **Services**: Core functionality for API communication and data management

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Build and run on an iOS device or simulator

## Implementation Plan

The project follows a phased approach:

- **Phase 1**: Core architecture and models *(Current)*
- **Phase 2**: UI implementation for main screens
- **Phase 3**: Collection management
- **Phase 4**: Paywall and monetization
- **Phase 5**: Error handling and reliability
- **Phase 6**: Performance optimization
- **Phase 7**: Polish and launch preparation
- **Phase 8**: Testing and launch
